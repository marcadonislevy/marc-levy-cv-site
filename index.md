I’m a commercial lead for data and infrastructure programmes, bringing more than 25 years of cost, commercial and project management expertise across hyperscale data centres, transport, utilities and other critical assets in the UK and Europe. I focus on contract strategy, governance and controls that keep complex portfolios aligned on value, while building AI-enabled tooling that makes commercial data usable in real time.
