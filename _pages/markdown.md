Welcome to the quick guide for this site. Content is deliberately concise and privacy-friendly: pages are static, avoid trackers, and focus on surfacing my work.

## What you can find
- **About & CV:** Background, credentials, and project history collected in the CV page.
- **Portfolio:** Highlights of current work including Quoralinex, CPMS, Sentinel-X, and energy prototypes.
- **Files & links:** Any supporting documents live in the <code>files/</code> directory.

## How the site is structured
- Navigation is intentionally minimal; additional sections (blog, publications, talks) will appear once they have public-ready content.
- Each page is written in Markdown and rendered statically so it loads quickly and keeps your data private.

## Future plans
- Add a lightweight search or index to make it easier to browse documents.
- Publish updates and short posts once real content is ready.

If you need something specific that is not yet published, please reach out directly.
