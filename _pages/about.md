Marc Levy Profile
---
I am a Commercial Lead of Cost, Commercial and Project Management with 25+ years’ experience delivering large-scale data centre, infrastructure, civil engineering, transport, utilities, and critical asset programmes across the UK and Europe.

My work sits at the intersection of commercial strategy, contracts, and technology. I lead multi-billion-pound portfolios, set commercial governance, and negotiate complex NEC, FIDIC, and JCT arrangements, while also designing the digital tooling that keeps those programmes under control.

I currently live in Rotterdam and work on hyperscale data centre programmes through Accenture, supporting clients from early business case and land strategy through design, procurement, construction, commissioning, and operations. Typical responsibilities include cost planning and benchmarking, risk and contingency modelling, change control, supplier frameworks, and executive reporting. I am comfortable operating from boardroom to site cabin, translating between legal, technical, financial, and delivery teams.

Alongside my commercial work, I am actively developing as a software engineer. I maintain several GitHub repositories focused on practical tools for project and commercial management, including full-stack applications built with TypeScript, React, Node.js, Cloudflare Workers & Pages, and the Hono framework. Recent work includes an in-house Contract & Project Management System (CPMS) for NEC/FIDIC/JCT, internal portals, and experiments with AI-assisted contract review and cost analytics. ORCID and GitHub together reflect this dual profile: commercial leader and hands-on technical builder.

Academically, I hold a Master of Laws (LLM) in International Commercial Law and I am currently pursuing a portfolio of advanced postgraduate degrees:
– MSc Engineering with Construction Management (Abertay University)
– MBA Entrepreneurship (University of Wolverhampton)
– MSc Logistics and Supply Chain Management (University of Hull)
– Global Executive MBA (AI) (University of Hertfordshire)
– MBA Project Management (Wrexham Glyndŵr University)
– MBA with Finance (St Mary’s University)

I also hold multiple chartered and fellowship-level professional memberships in cost, commercial, and project management disciplines.

Under the Quoralinex / Q1X umbrella, I am building a family of venture projects that link this experience back into industry: CPMS for smarter contract management, Sentinel-X for advanced protective equipment, AquaCore and Currents for novel energy concepts, and Equitable Journeys, a not-for-profit platform focused on career development and access to learning. Many of these ideas are prototyped in public via my GitHub repositories, where code, data models, and documentation are openly iterated.

Outside work, I recharge through travel, house music, cycling, films, and the occasional manga binge. I value credible, nuanced discussion, enjoy mentoring early-career professionals, and am particularly interested in how AI, modern software practices, and thoughtful procurement design can make major projects fairer, leaner, and more effective.
