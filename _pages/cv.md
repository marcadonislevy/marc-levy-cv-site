This CV focuses on my leadership of cost, commercial and programme management across data centres, transport, utilities and other critical infrastructure. It highlights experience in commercial strategy, contract governance, supplier performance and decision support for multi-billion-pound portfolios, alongside the data, AI and software tooling I develop to make commercial information usable in real time.
