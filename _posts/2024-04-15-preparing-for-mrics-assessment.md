I am currently preparing for my **MRICS assessment**, with the intention to submit in the September 2024 window.

I am seeking support in three specific areas:

- **Counsellor** – a chartered surveyor (MRICS or FRICS) who can guide my submission, review competencies and challenge my evidence.  
- **Proposers and Seconders** – a total of three MRICS / FRICS professionals for the fit-and-proper test.  
- **Peer review and challenge** – people willing to test my case studies, ethics responses and presentation narrative.

My background includes 25+ years in **cost, commercial and project management**, with experience across data centres, transport, utilities, highways and civil engineering, supported by Fellowships with FCABE, FCMI, FCIHT, FCILT, MIET and GMICE.

If you are interested in supporting my MRICS journey – or sharing your experience of the process – I would be glad to connect.
