I recently joined the **Harvard Business Review (HBR) Advisory Council**.

As part of the Council, I contribute feedback on research, articles and leadership insights that shape future HBR content. My focus areas:

- **Leadership and governance** in large, complex programmes  
- **Commercial strategy** across data centres, infrastructure and transport  
- **The impact of AI** on management practice, decision-making and organisational design  

This sits alongside my professional Fellowships – **C.Build E FCABE, FCMI, FCIHT, FCILT, MIET, GMICE** – and aligns with how I work day-to-day: bridging commercial, technical and strategic conversations.

The aim is simple: bring a practitioner’s perspective from major programmes in the UK and Europe into global leadership thinking.
