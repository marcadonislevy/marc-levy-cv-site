I spend a lot of time looking at where AI is actually useful in commercial practice – not just as a buzzword but as a tool that saves time, money and stress.

A few of the model “families” I keep coming back to:

1. **LAM – Language Action Models**  
   Not just chat, but models that execute actions in systems: trigger workflows, call APIs, move data.

2. **MoE – Mixture of Experts**  
   Architectures like GPT-4o where specialist “experts” handle different tasks, improving efficiency and scale.

3. **LLM – Large Language Models**  
   The core engines for reasoning, drafting, coding, and decision support across my commercial, legal and technical work.

4. **SAM – Segment Anything Models**  
   Computer-vision models that can identify any object in an image – useful wherever asset condition, defects or safety issues need visual checking.

5. **RAG – Retrieval-Augmented Generation**  
   My preferred pattern for serious work: combine live, authoritative data with an LLM so answers stay grounded in reality.

As a commercial lead, I am less interested in model hype and more in **how these tools change procurement, risk, reporting and decision-making** on real programmes.

If you want to explore how AI can be embedded into cost, commercial and project management – rather than bolted on as an experiment – this is where the conversation starts.
