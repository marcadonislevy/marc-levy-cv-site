Over the last 25+ years I have led and supported commercial and programme teams across a range of major projects in the UK and Europe. A few highlights:

## Google – Eemshaven Data Center (GRQ5A)

Commercial and cost leadership on a hyperscale data centre in the Netherlands, including:

- Multi-billion Euro programme governance  
- Contract strategy and negotiation across NEC, FIDIC and JCT forms  
- Cost assurance, benchmarking and change control in a live, fast-track environment  

## High Speed Two (HS2)

Senior Cost Manager working on one of Europe’s most complex transport programmes:

- Cost and risk management for major civils and systems packages  
- Integration of commercial controls with programme-wide reporting  
- Stakeholder engagement with government, delivery partners and supply chain  

## Transport for London & London Underground

Multiple roles across **commercial, programme and pre-construction management**, including:

- Turnaround of underperforming projects using lean and continuous improvement  
- Commercial strategy for renewals and enhancement portfolios  
- Data-driven reporting for executive and political stakeholders  

## Other Selected Roles

- **Brent Cross Cricklewood masterplan** – senior commercial management on a major regeneration programme.  
- **Glan Agua UK** – driving commercial success in utilities and water infrastructure.  
- **Oxfordshire County Council** – leading economic growth and infrastructure initiatives.  

These case studies all share a common theme: **using disciplined commercial management, clear data and strong stakeholder relationships to create value and reduce risk** on complex, politically visible projects.
